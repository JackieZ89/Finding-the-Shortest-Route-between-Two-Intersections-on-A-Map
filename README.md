# Finding-the-Shortest-Route-between-Two-Intersections-on-A-Map
Data Structure Project
• Utilized graph data structure and Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest route; Achieved an average run-time of 3000 milliseconds when running on New York City map
• Visualized maps using Java Graphics by reading in formatted data of intersections and roads
• Applied Object-Oriented Programming approach; combined priority queue and hash table to accelerate searching process
